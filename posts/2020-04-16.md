- Don’t always need to hit the hi-string / sometimes that’s all you need to hit
- Two middle fingers is all you need
- Try and play at the edge of your ability, that’s where you find the mistakes worth pursuing as techniques
- A slide does not need to start or end on a “note” (a slide can be a suggestion)
- Let open strings ring when struck (get out of the way)
- Jump off a string when you leave for another
