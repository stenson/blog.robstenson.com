title: What is a gradient?
---

Working on more 2D(-ish) graphics in Blender, such an intuitive workflow. For instance, I stretched out a simple plane and then light the scene with an overhead light, not really even noticing that putting the light there created a nice subtle gradient across the simple plane. Generally I don't reach for a "gradient" when designing with standard 2D digital design tools — I struggle with getting them just right. And I know there are people out there who love 2D gradient tools; there are also people who love drawing, an art of gradation & hand-done gradients. But when you tend towards a photographic workflow (I guess I just mean, _you like taking photographs_), it’s very satisfying to use a 3D tool that imitates that kind of almost tactile experience of arranging objects in order to photograph them.

Again the idea of 2D-from-3D-from-2D: the idea in your head; the physical realization of it; the camera that flattens it all again. Hard not to think of the camera as something quite similar to the printing press: something that flattens.

(Also, metal type truly a 2D-from-3D-from-2D (or, maybe more eloquently put, a 2D idea that must pass through the third dimension briefly))
