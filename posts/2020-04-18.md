title: things Len Lye does to type
---

_This has been a google doc tab open on my computer for months — I was trying to catalog typographic "moves" Len Lye performs in [Trade Tattoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AecUjE1Fk3Q), his incredible animated film from 1937._

_So here’s a list I compiled of things Len Lye does to type (in Trade Tattoo, 1937):_

- Changes the tracking
- Changes the case
- Adds an underline
- Repeats the same word in a cascade
- Scrambles the letters on a percussion hit
