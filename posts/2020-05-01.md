title: a taste for distortion
---

Distortion is on my mind, quite a lot lately. Why did musicians and listeners start craving electric distortion in the 1950s?

(A deeper question is: what is distortion? A buzzing sound? A distorted fiddle kind of just sounds like a fiddle, after all.)

One thought: did commercial radios (a radio in every home) create a taste for distortion? Surely those little radios distorted like crazy. So when electric guitarists discovered they could turn up their tube amps & get a similar sound, that must’ve been thrilling — an immediate sense of "hearing yourself on the radio," in the same way it’s thrilling to plug a guitar into a distortion pedal today — the thrill of sounding like what you’ve heard before.
