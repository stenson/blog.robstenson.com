title: Pity for the permit

Reading Esther McCoy’s _Five California Architects_ (amazed I didn't know about her until now!) — excellent book, though not quite as good as the collected writings in _Piecing Together Los Angeles_. Oh actually the chapter on Greene and Greene was written by Randall Makinson — loved the closing note: when the brothers were awarded with a AIA citation in 1952, Henry noted in his remarks: "In my day, you could proceed to do a job and carry it out completely. We didn't need to have inspections. A craftsman's work was his reputation." As Makinson notes, "He pitied those who lived and worked in what he called this period of transition."

Heard something recently from a mid-century architect looking back at his era, that he pitied today's architects because they had to draw up 100 pages of plans when he only had to do 7.
