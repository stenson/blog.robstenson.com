title: An atlas of programming languages?
---

Been re-reading the truly weird & cool _Atlas of Remote Islands: Fifty Islands I Have Never Set Foot On and Never Will_ — beautiful illustrations, though a little unsatisfying in how elliptic its little text entries (prose poems?) are — tantalizing but in a way that kind of begs for more information.

Made me think I'd like to write a similar book, but about programming languages, visiting many different ones and moving forward through time over the course of the story — would be fun to render topographic-ish, shaded 3D views of syntax-highlighted computer code, then have a facing page with just a little prose poem about the language.

Gosh, so many places to visit! APL would be cool.

There must be some book out there like this? A high-level, slightly artsy introduction to many different programming languages?
