Idle thought, given that everything we do is informed by nature — was writing inspired by the reading of animal prints? A hoof in the dirt is remarkably similar to early writing — a legible mark that transcends time but not space. And quite 2D, "pressed" like a piece of type. The ancient world must've been full of pressings in soft clay, but none of those survive. (why would soft clay survive?)
