title: an instrument is an interface
---

So often we hear that the reason to use "real" instruments (and not virtual ones), is because the _sound_ or particular _tone_ of a real instrument cannot really be replicated with digital tools. But what has occurred to me recently, now that I’ve been playing guitar more and more, is that tone of the instrument is not really what I’m after. Tone easy to manipulate after the fact (yes your guitar has a twangy sound, but so does mine when I cut the low frequencies). What’s difficult to replicate with digital tools is the physical interface a particular instrument offers you. Well, offers might be the wrong word — more like the interface that a particular instruments forces you to think with; in many cases, that interface is guiding your musical decisions. A banjo is an excellent example — you’d have to completely re-learn how to play piano in order to enter clawhammer banjo properly with a midi keyboard.

Drums, as well. The tones are all there, readily available online — multisampled, easy to find. But the interface of a drumkit — its bizarre layout, its proximities — pulls sound in a certain direction.

Maybe more of a half-thought.
