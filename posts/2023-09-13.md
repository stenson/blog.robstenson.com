title: A taste for modularity
---

Have wondered for a little while now why I don’t like John Lautner buildings all that much. I mean I don’t dislike them; it’s more that they just don’t _do_ it for me. Cool? Yes. Very cool? No. (Also, I’ll admit, I’ve liked him a lot less since I found out he hated Los Angeles even though he lived and worked here. Apparently he just lived here so he could have clients who liked his work, which is like... you hate the place that attracts people with similar taste as you?)

Then the other day it struck me that Lautner’s architecture is, in many ways, anti-modular. Every building, even if it has a Lautner signature style, is totally unique. Each building was a work of art. Contrast that with someone like Gregory Ain, someone so interested in the modernist _tract_ — the repeatable, the inexpensive, the attainable, the modular.

I find myself repeatedly drawn to modularity. Fonts rather than lettering; guitar chords rather than guitar solos; fiddle tunes rather than free improvisation; brickwork rather than woodwork; a system for designing audio plugin interfaces rather than unique interfaces for every plugin.

Not sure there's much to that thought. I guess I just like working with stuff, although usually drawn to the limits of modularity. Messing with fonts until they're close to unrecognizable; messing with fiddle tunes until they're close to unrecognizable; a system for designing audio plugins that's so complex no one can understand it.
