title: “having chords”
---

For a long time, one & off, I’ve attempted to pair clawhammer banjo music with other instruments that I play, like guitar or bass. This seems easy enough — after all, there is so much music in the world that pairs these things, usually also with a fiddle, aka "a stringband." But what brings me back to the banjo, year after year, is its open, almost floating sound, unmoored from traditional chord structures. I guess what I mean is, I don’t "know the chords" to any of the tunes I play on banjo. I know they "have chords," but when I look them up online and play along, the whole mood of the banjo changes — mooring it, or sinking it — situating it in a musical structure, rather than letting it float around as an ambiguous quality.

I am no stranger to chords, of course — rhythm guitar is my first musical love, and I have the Rickenbacker 360 to prove it (is anyone known for playing leads on a Rickenbacker 360?).

But to pair a guitar’s C chord with a banjo’s open-C tuning when playing some old fiddle tune... that just doesn’t do it for me!

Maybe it’s because the whole sound of the banjo comes from a time when the percussive music of West and Central Africa was only beginning to blend with the chord-heavy popular music of Northwest Europe?

Now banjo with a drone... that’s a different story — banjo with a bagpipe, a sustained open fifth 🙏🏻 — got to be as close to religion as I’ll ever get.
