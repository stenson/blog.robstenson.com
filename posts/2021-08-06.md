title: 3 from 2 / 2 from 3
---

Struck me the other day that, before computers, graphic artists & designers — i.e. people who wanted to make 2-dimensional things — always had to work with 3 dimensional things in order to get what they wanted. Paint brushes and metal type, obviously, or even the texture of oil paint on canvas, but I'm thinking more of the animation stand and the paste-up. No matter how two-dimensional the end result might seem (given the power of high-contrast lithofilm to "flatten"), what sits on the table is always three dimensional, even if only slightly: a piece of glass, a piece of paper curling up slightly at the edges (introducing a subtle shadow, the hallmark of cel animation).

Computers, of course, give humans the unique opportunity to _truly_ work in two dimensions. Unless of course you work in a 3D program. Still two dimensions, but 3D enough to trick our brains. Basically what I'm saying is: it's amazing how intuitive a (simulated) three dimensional workspace can be. You build a curved mirror in Blender, then slowly move it right-to-left, and — voila! — you have a core technique of Jean Fouchet. (Well, not that I know that's what he was doing, but clearly the guy liked mirrors.)
