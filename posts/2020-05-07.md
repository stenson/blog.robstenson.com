title: why was international garage rock so out of tune?
---

This is something I’ve been wondering about for a long time — certainly instruments used to be harder to tune, since tuners were rare / nonexistent up until quite recently. Even in high school I never had a pedal tuner for my guitar, actually I’ve never owned one of those.

But when you listen to old garage rock from Asia or Africa or South America, it is — almost inevitably — very out-of-tune. Even early reggae from Jamaica, the bass seems to always be drifting around, high or low.

My past hypothesis for why this happened:

- Humidity

That’s about it, although today I was thinking about it while playing my very out-of-tune Jazzmaster & hammering on the vibrato arm, and it occurred to me that maybe those early international rock-and-rollers had no particular interest in being "in tune." It is a deeply western construct, after all, the idea of 12 tones and equal temperament, especially on a stringed instrument. (All around the world people play lute-like instruments, but only in Europe were they fretted to an equal temperament.) What’s more, the 1960s represented the first time truly amateur musicians around the world were using such Western-made chordophones to imitate Western pop music, plus all their guitars had vibrato systems that ensure — if you use the vibrato arm a lot — that your guitar will basically be always out of tune.

Anyway that’s my current thinking: they simply didn’t care about "being in tune," insofar as that means "sounding in tune to western ears."
