title: Just cut it!

Incredible little anecdote — ran it by Diana who stared back at me blankly.

> When I interviewed Jacqueline Fouchet about the the work of her husband, title designer Jean Fouchet, she told me this funny anecdote. One day, Godard went to see Fouchet and asked him, “I want you to tell me how I can edit a sequence with very short shots,” and Fouchet replied, “Just cut it!” Godard, who didn’t expect such a straightforward answer, said: “You’re absolutely right!” and left. He then made the titles for Bande à Part a little while later.

 I think that might be something fascinating about film, that it's simple when you first watch it, then when you try to analyze it it seems complex, but then when you actually know how to do it, it seems incredibly simple again. Maybe that's common to a lot of things, I guess.
