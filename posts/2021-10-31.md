title: Is a fiddle tune like a bmx line?
---

Playing more and more banjo the last week or so, and actually learning some new tunes. Struck by how similar a tune is to a trail in mountain biking or a line in bmx/parkour or something like that. That is, the tune is the trail, everyone rides it differently. Some people concentrate on "perfecting" it (for speed or style), and others concentrate on doing weird new tricks every time they encounter it. (Feel like I'm in the latter camp.) Guess I'm thinking of Sam Pilgrim here lol.
