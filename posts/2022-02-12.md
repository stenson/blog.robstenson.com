title: Architecture and film
---

A few years ago, when I first wanted to know more about filmmaking, I realized that film seemed like a natural fit for my interests, given that it combines sound, vision, and time. I became somewhat obsessed, back then, with how silly it was of me not to realize that sooner — i.e. that I had failed to realize that there was something out there that combined all my interests so neatly.

What did not occur to me then (though what did just occur to me this morning when I picked up an old Christmas gift from the bookcase) was that architecture encompasses those three as well, in addition to space. (The gift was Paul Goldberger’s _Why Architecture Matters_, which I think my parents had signed for me? Need to ask them about that.)

The subtext here is that I majored in the history of architecture, so it’s a little funny to me that I had never thought about architecture as the original syncretic art form, even though now that I’m thinking about it, that point was stressed over and over again in school (i.e. the _gesamtkunstwerk_), and I’ve been obsessed with pipe organs, which are so obviously an incredible combination of sound, vision, time, & space. Hope to play a pipe organ one day.
