title: Whatâ€™s the best way to make a curve?
---

Not much of a thought here, and not something I've really explored in Blender, but was struck by the difference of approach in making "smooth" things in 3D programs vs. 2D graphic design tools, where the bezier curve reigns supreme. I guess it's interesting to me because the 3D approach seems a little more like traditional methods: you approximate a curve or curved surface with straight-edged polygons, then you smooth that out with other tools, kind of like a sander in a woodshop, as opposed to the bezier approach, which is to dial the curve in literally using a generic math equation and as few points as possible. Hmm I guess a lathe is kind of like that, although a lathe can only make one type of curvature right?

Interesting as well given that I'm sure 3D tools are more common in automative design these days, even though automative design is where bezier curves began (I think?)

Lots more questions here than usual, but worth wondering about.
