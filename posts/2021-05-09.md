title: Are rally stage notes a vector description language?
---

Hard to believe, but have become very interested in Rally (Rallye) — i.e. racing in stock-ish cars on public roads, often not asphalt (or “tarmac” as they seem to say). Fascinating sport, closer to the original idea of a car race, i.e. a long distance in stages. (Wonder what the history of “stages” in racing is...)

Most interesting part of rally is the co-driver reading pace notes to the driver as they drive, especially once I started playing the game Dirt Rally 2.0, which features pace notes prominently as part of the game play. (Didn’t realize previously how auditory car racing is, both in terms of listening to the revs of engine for when to change gears, but also listening to the co-driver). "6 left over small cut... double caution, hairpin right," etc. Struck by the idea that their little dialect of abbreviations is almost equivalent to a vector description language, `moveTo`, `lineTo`, `curveTo`. Would be interesting to create a programming dialect inspired by the relative degree-of-curve approach that rally notes employ. Might be an easier way to "write" a curve?
