title: Is “Le Mans” a film from a dead genre?
---

Watched _Le Mans_, the 1971 Steve McQueen film. Kind of incredible — the first dialogue appears 38 minutes into the film. Seems to be representative of a lost genre of film-making, the lightly-fictionalized documentary — a film whose plot is really just that it captures, on 35mm film, a major event that otherwise would not have been viewable had you not attended in person. Much like _Grand Prix_ (with its very stylish and bizarre title sequence courtesy of Saul Bass), except this feels even more stripped down. Lap after lap — some scored with jazz music for a little racing choreography. Funny that now every F1 race has cameras on every car — hard to really understand what a thrill it would've been to see the road from the cockpit of a Porsche racing car. As McQueen put it at the time, he wanted to get racing "down on film."

Also watched the documentary about it, _The Man and Le Mans_. Really mediocre documentary (the most boring score possible, & not enough archival film even though they had access to all of it (?)), but an interesting backstory. Basically McQueen wanted the film to be an expensive documentary, but no one paying for the film wanted that, so that's why it had a poem's worth of plot & it was a total flop (even though the documentary doesn't say that? lol).
