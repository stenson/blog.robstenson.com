title: Another difficult journey
---

Recently watched [this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_rjBWmc1iQ) about who wrote the Disney Channel theme song. Truly couldn't care less about the Disney Channel theme song, but did love the video, and struck me about half way through this was, yet again, a difficult journey to an arbitrary destination, i.e. I don't care who wrote the Disney Channel theme song, but itâ€™s still so much fun to watch someone struggle to figure it out.
