title: Expanding what a writer can do
---

Not much of a thought, but related to some previous posts here, in the area of _is-programming-writing?_, or _is-code-a-description_? Really just that idea that, a writer is, often, someone who describes something (a scene, an idea, a person). And a programmer is the same — someone who, often, describes something (an algorithm, an interface). A fundamental similarity, which lead me to wonder: does programming represent an expansion of what a "writer" can accomplish?

Hmm you know now that I've written this out it's not very interesting. I think what I'm trying to get at is that _description_ as an activity could only get you so far in the past. To sculpt something in three dimensions, you had to _do it_. But with a computer, you can do what a writer’s always done: describe it.

(Always leading me back to what that photographer said: _why sit a computer if you can do it?_ (to which I thought immediately, _why do it if I can sit at a computer?_))
