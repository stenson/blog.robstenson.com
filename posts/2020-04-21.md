title: are videos better than books?
---

Watching more and more deep-nerd content about guitars; stumbled upon “Five Watt World,” which does in-depth histories of specific instruments, like the Stratocaster or the Jazzmaster, ala https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKKy68FFNQ

It struck me while watching the Jazzmaster video: is this a better way to present this information than a book or blog post? It’s hard to imagine a “printed” work so densely illustrated, since it’d be impossible to read. Truly fascinating the ways in which a YouTube video like this blends so many forms of media, and also does away with the trappings of standard video documentary work. There is little-to-no soundtrack here, and why would there be? This is closer to a lecture than a documentary, but is so much more well-illustrated and crisply-delivered than any lecture I’ve ever attended. I’ve always thought of books as the “rawest” form of fact-based content, but videos like this make me question that idea, especially given that videos don’t need to be presented in the same formal English book-prose that written work often demands.

Love the hypocrisy of this whole idea as I write my ideas down in long boring unillustrated semi-formal English book-prose lol.
