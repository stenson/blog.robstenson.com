Gaspipe lettering! Finally I know a name for the style of a local signpainter whose work is everywhere in a ~5 mile radius around my house (his name is Ulises, according to a brief internet search heâ€™s a Colombian-American who first came to America to be a flyweight boxer in the 1960s? Still need to contact him).

Thanks to Stephen Coles for this excellent page of gaspipe examples: https://picpile.stewf.com/327576
