title: “Why isn’t our music as powerful as the Greeks’?”
---

Been reading the really great _A History of the Lute_ by Douglas Alton Smith (a book I had to buy directly from the Lute Society of America) — a fun read, with great details about how medieval/renaissance/baroque Europeans believed their lute to be the same as the Greek lyre. (Apparently even some Arabic scholars believed their ‘oud to be invented by “The Philoshopers” (aka the Greeks).)

But the show-stopper fact was that many Greek myths told stories about the magical power of music to do things like erect walls in cities or stop wars (i.e. _so-and-so played their lyre and the bricks arranged themselves into walls around the city..._ that kind of thing), and when early modern Europeans read those myths, they were perplexed: _why is our music so inferior that it doesn't have magical powers?_
