title: Are chords good with banjo?
---

Something that I think about a lot in relation to banjo is harmonic context, or at least that’s the phrase I think of — “harmonic context” — not that I know if that’s how people usually refer to the concept, but the idea is essentially: the magic of old fiddle tunes (played either on fiddle or banjo) is that they are often harmonically ambiguous — magic to me probably because so much pop music is harmonically unambiguous, i.e. based on chord changes. Of course, fiddle tunes “have chords,” but they don’t _need_ to have chords, which is why I love the sound of a solo banjo or two fiddlers: there is so much sound that isn’t there that usually would be, both harmonically and rhythmically. But when you add a rhythm guitar and a bass and a mandolin, etc., add of that implied rhythm and harmony is made literal. (I love chords, but they just feel counter-productive in banjo music.)

Basically all I'm trying to say is: "string band" music is often a bummer to me, but [this new album](https://brittanyhaas.bandcamp.com/album/impromptu-sessions-no-1-brittany-haas) by Brittany Haas is incredibly cool, because it’s more than just banjo, but less than — or just different than — a full string band. More harmony that a banjo would create by itself, or at least more complex harmony than a banjo would create by itself, but without the full chords of a guitar or a piano, the music is still wonderfully ambiguous.
