title: is fuzz a fiddle?
---

Been reading more and more about historical guitar pedals, after cracking open a copy of _Pedal Crush_. Really loved reading about the origin of fuzz, and loved hearing the first fuzz solo ever, at about 1:27 in [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/0dPfKBYyPmoSfoLJqeKAs4?si=ey6B3oCnTRqc8c7trW3bmw).

_Pedal Crush_ made the point that a lot of early fuzz was thought of as an aesthetic similar to horns, which I’d never thought about but does make a lot of sense: early rock players would’ve grown up in a world full of loud brass — from jazz, from military bands — and while the sounds are different, the dynamics are very similar — the kind of buzzy sustain you get on a guitar with a fuzz does catapult you out of a plucked string-instrument aesthetic and into horn-world. (Oh or also just sounds a lot like a fiddle? Like fiddle but so much easier than fiddle.)

Also while I’ve been reading about early pedals and early pedal distortion, I haven’t come across any reference to all the organic distortions present in pre-electronic African music — the spider webs used to make xylophones buzz, the bells hung from strings on harps — meant to create the kinds of textures that we now associate with rock music.

Been thinking more and more about this fiddle connection — kind of incredible, given that the first example of fuzz is in country music, where long-held buzzy fiddle notes are extremely common. Fascinating!

A lot of googling about fuzz guitars, was reminded of Takeshi Terauchi, just thought I’d leave this here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI5coxuM-mw
